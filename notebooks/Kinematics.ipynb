    "As explained in other notebooks, usign ReachySDK you can change the joints positions if and only if the motors are in stiff mode. There are two ways to send a new target position: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **with goal_position**: when this attribute is set, the joint will try to reach the position it as fast as it can and it can be pretty fast (up to 700 degrees per second). You can lower the *speed_limit* but we don't recommend to use this method as it gets really hard to follow complex trajectories and have precise timing. Even though you can change the motor speed, you have no control over the acceleration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **using goto()**: instead of playing with the goal_position you can use the *goto* method that is implemented in the SDK. This method generates a trajectory between the present position and the goal position. This trajectory is then interpolated at a predefined frequency (100Hz) to compute all intermediary target positions that should be followed before reaching the final goal position. Depending on the interpolation mode chosen, you can have a better control over speed and acceleration.\n",
