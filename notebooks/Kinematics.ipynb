    "As explained in other notebooks, you can change with the SDK the position of the joints if and only if the motors are in stiff mode. There are two ways to send a new target position: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **goal_position**: when this attribute is set, the joint will try to reach it as fast as it can and it can be pretty fast (up to 700 degrees per second). You can lower the *speed_limit* but we don't recommend to use this method as it gets really hard to follow complex trajectories and have precise timing. Even though you can change the motor speed, you have no control over the acceleration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **goto()**: instead of playing with the goal_position you can use the *goto* method that is implemented in the SDK. This method generates a trajectory between the present position and the goal position. This trajectory is then interpolated at a predefined frequency (100Hz) to compute all intermediary target position that should be followed before reaching the final goal position. Depending on the interpolation mode chosen, you can have a better control over speed and acceleration.\n",
